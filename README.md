# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
I'm choosing Option 2 - AirBnB Dataset to work on for this Tableau project.

The overall goals/objectives of this project are:

- Identify trends and patterns in pricing across different neighborhoods and property types.
- Forecast the number of new hosts over time to anticipate market growth.
- Cluster property types based on pricing to gain insights into market segments.
- Visualize the density and distribution of records to identify areas of high activity.
- Explore the distribution of beds across room types to understand accommodation preferences.
- Finally, create a dashboard to present the analyzed data and visualizations in a clear and concise manner.

In summary, the project aims to gain insights into the Airbnb market in New York City by analyzing pricing, growth, property types, and other relevant factors. The visualizations and dashboard provide a comprehensive view of the data to support decision-making and understanding of the market dynamics.

## Process
### Step 1
Data Import: I imported the "AirBnB_NYC" dataset into Tableau, which includes columns such as Host ID, Host Since, Name, Neighbourhood, Property Type, Room Type, and Zipcode.

### Step 2
I created the following visualizations in order:

1. I created a line chart showing the average price for each neighborhood over time. This visualization helps understand the price trends across different neighborhoods in NYC.

2. I then created a line chart with forecasting to predict the number of new hosts over time. This allows us to anticipate the growth in the number of hosts based on historical data and trends.

3. Next, I created a clustering visualization to analyze the average price based on property types. This helps identify patterns and groupings in prices based on different property types.

4. I created a heatmap to visualize the number of records. This provides an overview of the density or concentration of records across different areas or categories.

5. I created a visualization showing the number of beds based on room type. This helps understand the distribution of bed counts for different types of rooms.

### Step 3
Lastly, I created a dashboard that combines all the above charts. 

- I positioned each visualization on the dashboard canvas, adjusting their sizes and arrangement to optimize the layout and maximize the use of space.

- I reviewed and adjusted the labels and legends for each visualization to ensure clarity and understanding. This involved modifying axis labels, chart titles, and legends to provide meaningful descriptions of the data being displayed.

- To enhance interactivity, I applied filters that are relevant and comprehensive across all related datasets in the dashboard. When a user interacts with a filter, such as selecting a specific year or property type, it applies to all visualizations within the dashboard. This allows for dynamic exploration of the data and provides a holistic view of the selected data subsets.

- I ensured that the filters were synchronized across all visualizations, so that the selected data subsets remain consistent throughout the dashboard.

- Additionally, I incorporated tooltips in the visualizations to provide detailed information when hovering over data points. This allows users to access additional insights and specifics about the data.

The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the data, allowing for easy comparison and analysis of different aspects of the Airbnb listings in NYC.

## Results
I chose Option 2 - AirBnB dataset to work on this Tableau project.
Based on the visualization charts I have created, there are some questions that can be addressed accordingly.

1. Average price each neighborhood over time (Line chart):
- How does the average price vary across different neighborhoods in NYC?
- Are there any notable trends or patterns in the price fluctuations over time?
- Which neighborhoods have the highest and lowest average prices?

2. Forecast number of new hosts over time (Line chart and forecast):
- How is the number of new hosts in the Airbnb dataset expected to change over time?
- Can we identify any growth trends or patterns in the number of new hosts?
- What are the projected future trends for the number of new hosts?

3. Average price based on property type (Clustering):
- How do the average prices differ among different property types?
- Are there distinct clusters or groupings of property types with similar price ranges?
- Which property types tend to have the highest and lowest average prices?

4. Number of records (Heatmap):
- Where are the areas or categories with the highest concentration of records in the dataset?
- Can we identify any spatial patterns or density of records across different regions or categories?
- Which areas or categories have the highest and lowest number of records?

5. Number of beds based on room type:
- How does the distribution of bed counts vary across different types of rooms?
- Which room types tend to have more beds on average?
- Are there any room types that consistently have a higher or lower number of beds?

## Challenges 
Below are some challenges I encountered during the project:

- The first challenge I encountered was the initial difficulty in working with Option 1, as the dataset was not clean and lacked clear common keys for connecting tables. Additionally, the provided data questions may have been unclear or vague, making it challenging to determine the specific insights to focus on. So I decided to move on with Option 2 instead.

- Generating creative chart ideas: One of the initial challenges I faced was generating innovative and insightful chart ideas. Brainstorming and exploring various chart options took time and effort to ensure the charts effectively communicated the intended information.

- Selecting appropriate chart types: Choosing the most suitable chart types for the data presented another challenge. I had to consider factors such as the data structure, the relationships I wanted to emphasize, and the audience's comprehension and preferences.

- In addition to these challenges, the process of creating a clean and efficient dashboard demanded significant time and effort. Designing the layout, optimizing the visual arrangement, adjusting labels, legends, and filters, and ensuring a seamless user experience required meticulous attention to detail and iteration.
